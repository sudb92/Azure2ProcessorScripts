# Azure2ProcessorScripts
A collection of python3 scripts that help with post-processing and controlling operations of Azure2, a popular R-matrix program used in Nuclear Astrophysics calculations

Tested on Azure2 as developed during 2018-2019 timeframe.

List of attached python3 scripts in this repository:

1. pretty_printer_python3.py (formerly spreadsheet_parser_python3.py)
  * Lives within the ./output/ directory
  * Reads as input a (possibly voluminous) 'parameters.out', 'normalizations.out' and 'chiSquared.out' files
  * Generates outputs 'parsed-level-width.txt' that contain the levels and widths ordered in a table, with the normalization and chi2 information at the bottom
  * Other outputs can be tailored to ignore levels with zero widths, and/or dummy levels at a particular high energy.
  
2. parameters2azr_v0.4_python3.py
  * Lives in the main directory, alongside the main.azr file
  * Reads the 'parameters.out' and 'normalizations.out' generated during a calculation/fit
  * Reads in the main.azr that was used to generate the outputs using a calculation/fit
  * Fills in the output parameters and normalization to a copy of the main.azr read in(if so chosen) and saves the output .azr file
  * If the .out files were originally generated by a fit, this script helps to generate an azr file that can run a calculation at the chi2 minimum point of the fit. 
  
3. chi2explore_v0.2_python3.py
  * Lives in the main directory
  * Reads in a sample Azure2 .azr file, and generates all the parameters used in it
  * The user then inputs two parameters(can be energies or widths) to vary over a specifiable number of X-Y grid points.
  * The program then performs Azure **calculations**(for v0.2) at each of these x,y points and saves the results and the generated .azr files with the grid points in a folder called chi2search_folder
  * NOTE: This is not the procedure used by minOS, which does a ***FIT*** at each of the x,y points. Use v0.3 to recreate that.
